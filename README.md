Using R to compare the predictive capabilities of markets and models.

-------

In recent years, the forecast model has become a staple of political
punditry. Popularized by the data journalism site
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), the forecast model is a
statistical tool used to incorperate a number of quantitative inputs and
output a probabalistic view of all possible outcomes.

On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, all mainstream forecasts
gave Hillary Clinton overwhelming odds to win the presidency.
FiveThirtyEight's forecast model gave Clinton the lowest odds, [at
71%](https://goo.gl/CLPrUC). Meanwhile, The New York Times Upshot
calculated [85%]((https://goo.gl/QES9vJ)) and the HuffPo Pollster's
prediction published an infamous [98% chance of a Clinton
victory](https://goo.gl/XJqwyD).

Is there a better alternative to forecasting models?

Markets are an alternative method used to ascertain a probabalistic
prediction of election results. Instead of a mathematical model
incorperating quantitative inputs, a market has self-interested traders
bet on the outcomes to determine the likelihood of each.

I posit that prediction markets may claim a distinct niche in the field
of political forecasting. In theory, prediction markets encompass the
data generated by forecasting models and crowdsource additional
unquantifiable variables.

This project compares the accuracy of markets and models in their
ability to predict the winner of many 2018 midterm congressional
elections.
