## Overview

The forecast model has become a staple of political punditry in recent years.
Popularized by the data journalism site [FiveThirtyEight][01], the forecasting
model is a statistical tool used to incorporate a number of quantitative inputs
to generate a _probabilistic_ view of all possible outcomes.

Prediction markets can be used as alternative method of generating similarly
probabilistic views of election outcomes. Markets utilize the economic forces of
price discovery and risk aversion to overcome the ideological bias of
self-interested traders on a binary options exchange.

Can markets help us predict elections better than the models? If so, under what
conditions?

I propose a null hypothesis of no difference between the proportion of accurate
predictions made by forecasting models and prediction markets in the 2018
congressional midterm elections.

#### Read Markets

Market data is courtesy of PredictIt.org, an exchange owned and operated by the
Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The past 90 days of all market
data can be scraped, but more in depth data is provided to partnered academic
researchers. The data for this project can be found in the `/data` directory of
the GitHub repository.

```{r read_market}
DailyMarketData <-
  here::here("data", "DailyMarketData.csv") %>%
  read_delim(delim = "|",
             na = "n/a",
             col_types = cols(
               MarketId = col_character(),
               ContractName = col_character(),
               ContractSymbol = col_character(),
               Date = col_date(format = "")))

Market_ME02 <-
  here::here("data", "Market_ME02.csv") %>%
  read_csv(col_types = cols(ContractID = col_character(),
                            Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y")))

Contract_NY27 <-
  here::here("data" , "Contract_NY27.csv") %>%
  read_csv(na = c("n/a", "NA"),
           skip = 156,
           col_types = cols(ContractID = col_character(),
                            Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y")))
```

```{r print_market_raw, echo=FALSE}
DailyMarketData %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>%
  select(MarketSymbol, 
         ContractSymbol, 
         Date, 
         OpenPrice, 
         ClosePrice, 
         Volume) %>% 
  arrange(Date) %>% 
  kable(digits = 3,
        caption = "Input Market Data (Sample)")
```

#### Read Members

Market data lacks all the data needed to join it with model data, namely party
association for members of the Senate. This data can be found in the 
[the \\unitedstates project's][05] legislators data set [@legislators_current].

#### Read Models

While the FiveThirtyEight model proprietary, they release top level output data
free to the public as two separate files, one for the House
[@house_district_forecast] and one for the Senate [@senate_seat_forecast].

### Format Data

The objective of formatting is to create the neccesary variables needed to
perform the relational join for method comparison.

Formatting is done using `dplyr` [dplyr] and `tidyr` [@tidyr]. Character values
are formatted with `stringr` [@stringr] and `lubridate` [@lubridate] for dates.

The `race` variable comes from the state abbreviation and race number (e.g.,
VT-01, AZ-S1, MO-S2). 

Together with `date`, these two variables can be used
to match daily predictions together for comparison.

We will also need a `party` variable to filter out redundant observations.

#### Format Members

```{r format_members}
members <- legislators_current %>%
  unite(first_name, last_name,
        col = name,
        sep = " ") %>%
  rename(gid     = govtrack_id,
         chamber = type,
         class   = senate_class,
         birth   = birthday) %>%
  select(name, gid, birth, state, district, class, party, gender, chamber) %>%
  arrange(chamber)

members$name     %<>% iconv(to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")
members$name     %<>% str_replace_all("Robert Menendez", "Bob Menendez")
members$name     %<>% str_replace_all("Robert Casey",    "Bob Casey")
members$name     %<>% str_replace_all("Bernard Sanders", "Bernie Sanders")
members$chamber  %<>% recode("rep" = "house", "sen" = "senate")
members$district %<>% str_pad(width = 2, pad = "0")
members$class    %<>% str_pad(width = 2, pad = "S")
members$party    %<>% recode("Democrat"    = "D",
                             "Independent" = "D",

                            true = members$class,
                            false = members$district)

# Create district code as relational key

        remove = TRUE) %>%
  select(-class) %>%

# Format member stats for join
members_stats <-
  bind_rows(sponsorshipanalysis_h, sponsorshipanalysis_s,
            .id = "chamber") %>%

```

#### Format Markets

For market data, `race` comes from the the MarketID, which other contains the
candidate name of code itself.

```{r foromat_markets}
markets <- DailyMarketData %>%
  rename(mid      = MarketId,
         name     = MarketName,
         symbol   = MarketSymbol,
         party    = ContractName,
         open     = OpenPrice,
         close    = ClosePrice,
         high     = HighPrice,
         low      = LowPrice,
         volume   = Volume,
         date     = Date) %>%
  select(date, everything()) %>%
  select(-ContractSymbol)

# Get candidate names from full market question

  select(race, winner) %>%
  filter(race != "NC-09") # Harris fraud charges
```

### Combine Data

Not all races contain predictions for each party's probability. I will be using
only Democratic (or Independent) data. For the races with only Republican
predictions, the probability can simply be inverted.

```{r join_messy}
# Take the complimentary probability if only GOP data
# Find race codes for markets with data on only one candidate
single_party_markets <- markets %>%
  group_by(date, race) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n == 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull(race) %>%
  unique()

# Invert the GOP prices for markets with only GOP candidates
invert_gop <- markets %>%
  filter(race %in% single_party_markets,
         party == "R") %>%
  mutate(close = 1 - close,
         party = "D")

# Take all but the only GOP markets
original_dem <- markets %>%
  filter(!race %in% invert_gop$race,
         party == "D")

# Combined both back together
markets2 <-
  bind_rows(original_dem, invert_gop) %>%
  select(date, race, close) %>%

# Create model data with only dem party info
model2 <- model %>%

# Join democratic predictions from both markets and models for comparison
# Keep market and model data in seperate columns

## Results

Once predictions are combined, tidy-ed, and compared with election results, the 
predictive ability of each method can be assessed.

A test for equal proportion using the `stats` package shows a
statistically significant difference (Table 10) [@stats].

A test of forecast skill using the `verification` package shows
no statistical difference in Brier Scores (Table 12) [@verification].

```{r prop_test}
# Run a 2-sample test for equality of proportions
hits %>%
  select(date, race, method, hit) %>%
  spread(key = method,
         value = hit) %>%
  select(market, model) %>%
  colSums() %>%
  prop.test(n = nrow(hits)/2 %>% rep(2)) %>% 
  pander()

hits %>%
  group_by(pred, winner, method) %>%
  summarise(prob = mean(prob)) %>%
  arrange(pred, winner) %>% 
  spread(method, prob) %>% 
  kable(digits = 3,
        caption = "Mean Probabilities by Prediction Accuracy")
```

```{r brier_test}
hits %>%
  mutate(brier_score = (winner - prob)^2) %$%
  t.test(formula = brier_score ~ method) %>%

brier_model <- verification::brier(
  obs = hits_model$winner,
  pred = hits_model$prob) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe() %>% 
  slice(2:7)

hits_market <- hits %>% filter(method == "market")

brier_market <- verification::brier(
  obs = hits_market$winner,
  pred = hits_market$prob) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe() %>% 
  slice(2:7)
```

```{r}

## Application

The probabilities for the races can be visualized using the `shiny` package
[@shiny].

The application is hosted online at https://kiernan.shinyapps.io/predictr/

## Visualize

Exploratory visualizations are made using the `ggplot2` package [@ggplot2].
